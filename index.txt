All struct fields are mandatory----not true
when you create an instance of a struct in Go, you must provide values for all the fields. If you omit any field, the compiler will raise an error because it expects all fields to be initialized.

to make it optional

Use Zero Values: Assign default values to fields that are not provided. For example, an integer field will have a default value of 0, and a string field will have a default value of an empty string "".

Use Pointers: Use pointers for fields that you want to be optional. This way, you can check if a field is nil to determine if it was set.




How to run go files?

Go programs require a main package with a main function as the entry point for execution

package main

func main() {
  // write your code to execute
}

go run main.go

OR

Using modules

myproject/
├── go.mod
├── main.go
└── mylib/
    └── mylib.go

# main.go
package main
import "myproject/mylib"

func main() {
    mylib.Hello()
}

# mylib.go
package mylib
import "fmt"

func Hello() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from mylib package!")
}

# go.mod
module myproject
go 1.18

go run main.go
